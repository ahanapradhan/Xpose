"This SQL query identifies the supplier with the highest total revenue from sales transactions within the first quarter of 1995. It calculates the total revenue for each supplier by summing up the extended price of items sold, adjusted for discounts, from the 'lineitem' table. The query then joins this revenue data with the 'supplier' table to retrieve the supplier's key, name, address, and phone number, specifically for the supplier with the maximum revenue during this period, and orders the results by the supplier key."
