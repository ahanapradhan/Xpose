"Based on the SQL query provided, the business operation involves calculating the total revenue generated from the sale of specific products that meet certain criteria. The products are filtered by brand, container type, quantity, size, shipping mode, and shipping instructions. Specifically, the query targets products from three brands ('Brand#12', 'Brand#23', and 'Brand#34') with specific container types and size ranges. The products must be shipped by air and delivered in person. The revenue is calculated by summing the extended price after applying a discount for each qualifying product. This analysis helps in understanding the revenue contribution from these specific product categories and shipping conditions."
