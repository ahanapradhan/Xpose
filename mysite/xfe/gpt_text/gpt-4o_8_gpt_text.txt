"The SQL query calculates the market share of products sold to India, specifically for 'ECONOMY ANODIZED STEEL' parts, over the years 1995 and 1996. It does this by determining the proportion of sales volume attributed to India compared to the total sales volume for each year. The data is filtered to include only transactions where the customer is from the Asia region, and the results are grouped and ordered by year to show the annual market share trend for the specified product type."
