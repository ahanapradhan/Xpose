"This SQL query is designed to analyze customer purchasing behavior by determining the distribution of customers based on the number of orders they have placed, excluding any orders with comments containing 'special requests'. It first calculates the number of orders for each customer, then groups these customers by the count of their orders, and finally provides a summary of how many customers fall into each order count category. The results are sorted to show the most common order counts first, providing insights into customer engagement and order frequency patterns."
