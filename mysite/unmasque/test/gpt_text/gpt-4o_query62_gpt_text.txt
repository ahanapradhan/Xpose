The data is aggregated and grouped by warehouse name (limited to the first 20 characters), shipping mode type, and website name, for a specific 12-month period. The report will provide insights into the efficiency of shipping operations across different warehouses, shipping modes, and websites, helping the business manager to identify areas for improvement in the logistics and supply chain processes.
