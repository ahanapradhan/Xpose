"This SQL query is designed to analyze inventory levels for items priced between $0.99 and $1.49 across various warehouses. It calculates the total inventory on hand before and after a specific date, May 13, 2000, within a 30-day window. The query then filters the results to include only those items where the ratio of inventory after the date to inventory before the date falls between two-thirds and one and a half. The results are sorted by warehouse name and item ID, and the output is limited to the top 100 records, providing insights into inventory changes for specific items in different warehouses."
