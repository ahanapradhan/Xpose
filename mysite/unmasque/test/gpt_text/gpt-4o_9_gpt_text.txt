"The SQL query calculates the annual profit for each nation by summing up the profit amounts derived from sales transactions. It extracts the year from the order date and computes the profit as the difference between the extended price after discount and the supply cost multiplied by the quantity. The data is aggregated by nation and year, and the results are ordered by nation and year in descending order. This analysis helps in understanding the profitability trends across different nations over time, specifically for products with names containing a certain pattern."
