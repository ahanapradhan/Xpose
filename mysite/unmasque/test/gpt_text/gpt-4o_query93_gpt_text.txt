It does this by joining sales and returns data, adjusting sales figures by subtracting the value of returned items when applicable. The query specifically filters for transactions associated with a particular return reason, labeled 'reason 38'. The results are grouped by customer and ordered by total sales and customer identifier, with the top 100 customers by sales being displayed."
