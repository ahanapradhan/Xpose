"The SQL query is designed to analyze shipping modes by categorizing and counting the number of high-priority and low-priority orders based on their order priority levels. It focuses on orders that have specific shipping modes, ensuring that the shipment was committed before being received and shipped before the commitment date, within a specified one-year period. The results are grouped and ordered by the shipping mode, providing insights into the distribution of urgent and non-urgent orders across different shipping methods."
