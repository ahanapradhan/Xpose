"This SQL query is designed to generate a report that provides insights into the sales performance of items sold in the year 2001, specifically targeting female customers with a secondary education level. The report focuses on sales data from selected states (KS, IA, AL, UT, VA, NC, TX) and considers customers born in specific months (August, April, February, May, November, September). It calculates average metrics such as quantity sold, list price, coupon amount, sales price, net profit, birth year, and department count, grouped by item ID and geographical location (country, state, county). The results are ordered by country, state, county, and item ID, and the output is limited to the top 100 records."
