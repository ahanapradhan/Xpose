"The business analysis involves identifying the top 100 performing products within each product category in terms of sales revenue over a specified one-year period. The analysis considers various dimensions such as product category, class, brand, and name, as well as the time dimensions of year, quarter, and month, and the specific store where the sales occurred. The query ranks products within each category by their total sales, calculated as the sum of sales price multiplied by quantity sold, and selects the top 100 products per category based on this ranking. This information can be used to understand sales performance trends and make informed decisions on inventory and marketing strategies."
