"The business logic is designed to evaluate sales
data from a 'store_sales' table, categorizing it
into five distinct quantity ranges (buckets) and
calculating either the average list price or the
average net profit for each range.
For each bucket, if the number of sales
transactions within the specified quantity
range exceeds a certain threshold,
the query returns the average list price;
otherwise, it returns the average net profit.
This analysis is filtered by a specific reason code
from the 'reason' table, where the reason key is equal
to 1, providing insights into sales performance based on quantity sold."
