"This SQL query is designed to analyze sales
data from the year 2000, focusing on items
purchased by female customers who are widowed
and have a secondary education level.
It calculates the average quantity sold,
list price, coupon amount, and sales price
for each item, specifically for transactions
where promotions were not conducted via email or events. The results are grouped by item ID and sorted in ascending order, with a limit of 100 items displayed. This analysis can help in understanding purchasing patterns and the effectiveness of non-email and non-event promotions for this specific customer demographic."
