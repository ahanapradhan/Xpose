"The business analysis focuses on evaluating store sales data from the year 2001, specifically targeting customers with distinct demographic profiles and purchase behaviors. The query calculates the average quantity sold, average extended sales price, average extended wholesale cost, and total extended wholesale cost for transactions that meet certain criteria. These criteria include customers with specific marital and education statuses, varying dependent counts, and sales prices within defined ranges. Additionally, the analysis is limited to customers residing in certain U.S. states with net profits falling within specified ranges. This data can help the business understand sales performance and customer demographics to tailor marketing strategies and optimize inventory management."
