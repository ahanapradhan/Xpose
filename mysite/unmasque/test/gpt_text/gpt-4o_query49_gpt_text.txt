"The business analysis focuses on identifying the
top-performing items in terms of return ratios and currency
ratios across three sales channels: web, catalog, and store,
for the month of December 1999. The query calculates
the return ratio and currency ratio for each item by
dividing the total return quantity and return amount by
the total quantity sold and net paid amount, respectively.
It ranks the items within each channel based on these ratios
and selects the top 10 items with the highest return and
currency ratios. The results are then combined and ordered
by channel and rank, providing a comprehensive view of the
items with the highest return impact across different sales
channels, limited to the top 100 results."
