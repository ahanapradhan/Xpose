The data is filtered to include only those promotions that were conducted through direct mail, email, or TV channels. The query aggregates sales data from various tables, including store sales, store, promotion, date, customer, customer address, and item, to compute the total sales and promotional sales, and then calculates the percentage of sales attributed to promotions. The results are ordered by the amount of promotional sales and total sales, and the output is limited to the top 100 records."
