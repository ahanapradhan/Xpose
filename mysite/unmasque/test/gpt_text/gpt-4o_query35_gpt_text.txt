"This SQL query is designed to analyze customer
demographics and purchasing behavior for the
year 2001, focusing on the first three quarters.
It examines customers who have made purchases
in-store, online, or through catalogs,
and groups the data by state, gender,
marital status, and various dependent counts
(total dependents, employed dependents,
and college-going dependents).
The query calculates statistical measures such
as count, standard deviation, average, and
maximum for these dependent categories,
providing insights into the distribution and
characteristics of customer households. The results are sorted and limited to the top 100 entries, offering a concise overview of customer demographics and their purchasing patterns."
