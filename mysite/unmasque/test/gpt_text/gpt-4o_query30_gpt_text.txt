"The business operation involves identifying
customers from the state of Indiana who returned
products purchased online in the year 2000 and
whose total return amount exceeds 120% of the
average return amount for that state. The query
retrieves detailed customer information, including
their ID, name, salutation, preferred customer
status, birth details, country of birth, login,
email address, and last review date, along with
their total return amount. The results are ordered by customer details and limited to the top 100 entries, providing insights into high-return customers for targeted business strategies."
