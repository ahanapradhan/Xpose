"This SQL query is designed to generate a report that identifies and ranks product categories based on the number of distinct suppliers available for each category. It filters out products of a specific brand and type, excludes certain product sizes, and omits suppliers who have received customer complaints. The results are grouped by product brand, type, and size, and are ordered by the number of suppliers in descending order, followed by brand, type, and size. This report can help a business manager understand the diversity of supplier options for different product categories while ensuring quality by excluding suppliers with negative feedback."
