It categorizes the sales based on the time taken to ship products after they were sold, dividing them into five time brackets: within 30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-120 days, and over 120 days. The report is grouped by the first 20 characters of the warehouse name, the type of shipping mode, and the call center name, and it is limited to the top 100 results.
