" This SQL query calculates the percentage of revenue generated from promotional items compared to the total revenue for all items sold within a specific month. It does this by summing up the revenue from items with a type starting with 'PROMO' and dividing it by the total revenue from all items, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. The data is filtered to include only those items shipped within a specified month, as determined by the 'l_shipdate' field. "
