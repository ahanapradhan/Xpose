"This SQL query generates a report listing the last and first names of customers, their current city, the city where they made a purchase, the sales ticket number, the total coupon amount, and the net profit from the sale. The data is filtered to include only those transactions where the household has either six dependents or no vehicles, and the purchase was made on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) during the years 2000, 2001, or 2002. Additionally, the purchases must have occurred in specific cities (Midway or Fairview), and the customer's current city must be different from the purchase city. The results are sorted by customer last name, first name, current city, purchase city, and ticket number, and are limited to the first 100 entries."
