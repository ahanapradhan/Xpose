"Based on the SQL query provided, the business operation involves analyzing customer sales data from both store and web channels over two consecutive years, specifically 2001 and 2002. The query identifies customers who have made purchases in both years and compares the growth rate of their web sales to their store sales. It selects customers whose web sales growth rate from 2001 to 2002 exceeds their store sales growth rate during the same period. The result is a list of up to 100 customers, including their ID, first name, last name, and birth country, who meet these criteria, sorted by their customer details."
