The query aggregates sales data from both store and web channels, calculates the total sales for each customer for the specified years, and compares the growth rates between the two channels. It then selects the top 100 customers who have a higher growth rate in web sales than in store sales, providing their customer ID, first name, last name, and birth country for further business insights and potential targeted marketing strategies."
