"The SQL query is designed to generate a report that identifies customers who have returned items within the first quarter of 1995, providing insights into their purchasing behavior and demographics. It calculates the total revenue lost due to returns by multiplying the extended price of returned items by the discount factor, and aggregates this data by customer. The report includes customer details such as customer key, name, account balance, address, phone number, and comments, as well as the nation name. The results are sorted in descending order of revenue lost, highlighting the customers with the highest return impact."
