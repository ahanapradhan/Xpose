"This SQL query is designed to provide a summary report of orders based on their priority levels over a specified three-month period. It counts the number of orders for each order priority where the order date falls within the given timeframe and where there is at least one line item in the order with a commit date earlier than the receipt date. The results are grouped and sorted by order priority, offering insights into the volume of orders by priority that may have experienced delays in their line items."
