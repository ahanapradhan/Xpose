"Based on the SQL query provided, the business analysis focuses on comparing cumulative sales data for items sold through web and store channels over a specific one-year period. The query calculates cumulative sales for each item by date from both web and store sales data, then identifies instances where the cumulative sales from the web channel exceed those from the store channel. The results are sorted by item and date, and the top 100 records are selected. This analysis helps in understanding the performance of web sales relative to store sales for each item, providing insights into which items are performing better online over time."
