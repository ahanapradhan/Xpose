"The business analysis focuses on comparing cumulative sales data for items sold through web and store channels over a specific 12-month period. The query calculates cumulative sales for each item by date for both web and store sales, then identifies instances where the cumulative web sales exceed the cumulative store sales. The results are sorted by item and date, and the top 100 records are selected. This analysis helps in understanding the performance of web sales relative to store sales for each item, providing insights into which items are performing better online compared to in-store."
