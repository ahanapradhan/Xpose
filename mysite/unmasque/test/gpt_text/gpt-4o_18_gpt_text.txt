"This SQL query is designed to generate a report that lists customer names, customer keys, order keys, order dates, and total order prices for orders that have a total quantity greater than a specified threshold. The report aggregates the total quantity of items per order and filters out orders that do not meet the specified quantity criteria. The results are grouped by customer and order details and are sorted in descending order by total price and order date, providing a prioritized view of high-value orders for business analysis."
