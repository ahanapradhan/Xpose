"To identify the top-performing supplier in terms of revenue, this SQL script first creates a view that calculates the total revenue generated by each supplier over a specified three-month period starting from January 1, 1995. The revenue is calculated by summing up the extended price of items, adjusted for discounts, for each supplier. The script then selects the supplier with the highest total revenue, retrieving their key details such as supplier number, name, address, and phone number. Finally, the view used for this calculation is dropped, ensuring no residual data remains."
