"Based on the provided SQL, the business operation involves creating a temporary view to calculate the total revenue generated by each supplier over a specified three-month period, taking into account discounts on extended prices. The query then identifies the supplier with the highest total revenue within this timeframe, retrieving their key details such as supplier number, name, address, and phone number. Finally, the temporary view is removed after the operation is complete. This process helps in identifying top-performing suppliers based on revenue, which can be crucial for strategic decision-making and supplier management."
