Given the above data, now look at the following query (let us call it Qs):

"
(Select 100 as d_week_seq1, NULL as round, NULL as round, NULL as round, NULL as round, NULL as round, NULL as round, 0.93 as round
 From date_dim do, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3,
 web_sales wo, web_sales w1
 Where do.d_date_sk = wo.ws_sold_date_sk
 and d3.d_date_sk = w1.ws_sold_date_sk
 and do.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
 and d1.d_year = 1998
 and d2.d_year = 1999
 and date_dim.d_week_seq <= 153
 Order By d_week_seq1 asc, round asc)
 UNION ALL
 (Select 100 as d_week_seq1, NULL as round,
 NULL as round, NULL as round, NULL as round,
 NULL as round, 0.92 as round, NULL as round
 From date_dim do, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3,
 catalog_sales co, catalog_sales c1
 Where do.d_date_sk = co.cs_sold_date_sk
 and d3.d_date_sk = c1.cs_sold_date_sk
 and do.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq

 and d2.d_year = 1999
 and date_dim.d_week_seq <= 153
 Order By d_week_seq1 asc, round asc)
 "

You have to refine this query to formulate some meaningful logic.
Consider the following possibilities while refining:
G1. Constants in the predicates in Qs are valid. But Constants in projections in Qs may be coming from the data. Replace them with table attribute names if that makes sense.
G2. Attributes within predicates may be used with aggregate functions.
G3. Conditional CASE statement can be added, if that makes sense.
G4. Nesting structure can be added, if that makes sense.
G5. If UNION ALL operator exists in Qs, group by can be done after performing union.
G6. An equi-join predicate of Qs can be refined with EXISTS or semi-join semantics, if that makes sense.
G7. Do not use any attribute that is not present in Qs.
Overall, your goal is to formulate a meaningful query out of the above query.

Edit distance:
100 and 153, made b99.d_week_seq - b98.d_week_seq = 53.
And removed   WHERE dd.d_week_seq IN (100, 153) from CTE.
It gives 52 rows output.
QH gives 2000+ outputs. But result has many duplicates.
Added group by to QH --> gives the same 52 rows output.
